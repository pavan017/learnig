/*
=> Immutable class in java means that once an object is created then after that we can not change its content
=> All wrapper class(Integer, Boolean) and String class is java is immutable
Following are the requirement
    => The class must be declared as final so that child class can't be created
    => Data Member must be declared as private so that direct access is not allowed
    => Data member must be final so that we can't change the value of it after object creation
    => A parameterized constructor should initialize all the fields performing a deep copy so that
     data members canâ€™t be modified with an object reference.
    => Deep Copy of objects should be performed in the getter methods to
     return a copy rather than returning the actual object reference)
