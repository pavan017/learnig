### Provide a time where you need to escalate something because progress was not been made 
- I am fortunate enough to work with people who are aware about the sourrounding 
- Not major a major one 
  - when i was in oracle our most of team is in US
  - Earlier when i join then there was only two people and we mostly working on stablising the system 
  - but down the line after six month we understood the system and able to contribute some small feature 
  - At that time our team size got increase from 2 to 5. 
  - At that movement i asked to my manager that we have some component which we can own from IST 
  - He was aware of that and asked me to wait for some transition which is about to happen and after that we got a owner ship of template management system for announcement
  - Which was completely own and maintained by IST team
  - 







### Provide an example where you felt that you could have done something but did not signup for this.

- I remember when we are doing NFR for big billion day. 
- At that point we are doing manual testing for feature 
- I have l1 test suit for couple of features which we can deploy and test. 
- I was asking to manager if we can deploy and get rid of manual effort 
- He asked me to hold on as the BBD is about to start and we dont want to take any risk 
- I understand the situation and let it go the L1 test suite and letter point of time i enabled that



### Give me an example of a time you did something wrong. How did you handle it?

- I am fortunate enough that i didn't do anything which cause any major things
- I always follow SOP. if SOP is not there i ask for the same and if its not exist then try to create one 
- I remember when I was in flipkart, there is one known issue. the solution for that issue to restart the machine 
- As i become oncall then the same issue occured and i did the same steps 
- But i was not aware that a new service was also running on that machine which become unavailable at that time
- And it started default routing. as its a night time so the customer effected is very less 
- And once it comes-up it still not coverup at that movement i got scared and ask the owner 
- He ask to run the job which set some config and restart the pod once again.
- It was a outage of 30 mins but somehow we are bale to handle 
- It cause me an RCA and i started an initiative of run book for production issue 
- Which supposed to be rveied by stack holder in regular time interwal
