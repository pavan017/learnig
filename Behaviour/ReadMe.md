##Team Lead 
- <b>What was your responsibility as a team lead</b>
    - As a team lead you are the main project representative for informing
    managers and other executive about the progess of that initiative
    - Influence without authority
    - Critical thinking 
    - Simplify problems and divide them in workable modules for the team
    - They have to be externally aware and look for ideas from everywhere
  
    
- <b>What is your favourite programing language and why do you like it</b> 
    - I worked on couple of programming language which i used for different-2 kind of projects 
    and i found that 
    - java is a multi purpose language which is easy to use, compile write and debug
    - Community of java programmer is huge and its easy to get lots of open source project for a certain type of problem.
    - One of the best thing about this language is that its a platform independent language.
  

- <b>What was the last project you led, and what was its outcome?</b>
  - My last project was template management system. Suppose you wanted to on-borad a service to utilize announcment serive 
    to send the announcement for an upcoming scheduled outage. then it was too dificult as onboarding process was not 
    automated and sla was 4 weeks. and it is also error prone. 
  - We come up with a solution which is nothing but a plugin where team can authinticate them self using
    service principal and start using template management plugin for unboard/offboard and other activities
  - By this automation we reduce the onboarding time from 4 weeks to 10 mins 
  - And also proper notification and visibility of pending task which is required to onboard a service on our system
  - it is visible to the stack holder so that they got to know the status using filter


 -<b> Give me an example of a time that you felt you went above and beyond at work </b>
  - Whenever time demands i am willing to put extra effort to make sure things are smooth with almost 0 cheoos.
  - We have to do security patching on montly basis and i observed that some some of the vunrability is
    just because we have to update some base image version which is published by central team every month
  - As it required a deployment which is taking couple of days and monitoring to complete this task 
  - As this task is a repetative task and need to be done on monthly baisis and i feel that this is something which 
    need to be automated to save lots of time on monty baisis 
  - I just googleit like how other organisation trying to solve this kind of issue and then i got to know that 
    oraganisation have a central team and which is maintaining a latest images for packages and you have to 
    register your service on them and they automatically push and restart your service whenever they update a new version 
    

-<b> Describe a time when your work was criticized, how you responded, and what happened as a result</b>
  - Healthy Critisicm really required to grow. I try to  take is an opportunity instead of setback 
  - Listen carefully and try to get datapoints as much as possible
  - Analyse those datapoint and make a plan to improve yourself 
  - make a plan so that small result is visible to you atleast 
  - When i was in flipkart i suppose to represent my team and informed about the development and progess
    for the given task as this project involves multiple to work on this task together. as i a representative of 
    my team i should keep all those meeting notes documented so that everyone should be on the same page 
    but due to lack of experience with stackholder team haven't done that which cause last movement cheose which c
    could be avaided with proper communication and by maintaining documents 
    
  - My manager polity descibe the situation and ask me to how we can get rid of this and 
    how we can make sure we should not be in the same situation in future 
  - From those incident i learn that i need to be more attentive when we are working with stackholders
    as they are not as technical as you are.
  - Try to avoid assumption instead ask it out.


-<b>Have you ever been on a team where someone was not doing their part? How did you handle it?</b>
  - I have seen a girl who is part of my team and i can that she is not performing as per her potential
  - As i have taken her interview so i am aware of her capabilities a little bit
  - I ask her if she comfertable to have an one on one meeting so that we can discuss
  - As the dedline was there and and i need her help to complete this project
  - When i discuss ask her what qare things bothering you the most 
  - Then she said that she is more inclined to a machine role and was less interested in backend role
  - In my surpise this is something which we have to be vochle about at upfront but she is little shy
    and it is hamperring her productivity 

- <b>What was the last project you led, and what was its outcome?</b>
  
- <b>Give me an example of a time that you felt you went above and beyond at work.</b>
- <b>Describe a time when your work was criticized, how you responded, and what happened as a result.</b>
- <b>Have you ever been on a team where someone was not doing their part? How did you handle it?</b>
- <b>Tell me about a time when you had to give someone difficult feedback. How did you handle it?</b>
- <b>How do you handle working with people who annoy you?</b>
- <b>What was the most difficult period in your life, and how did you deal with it?</b>
- <b>Give me an example of a time you did something wrong. How did you handle it?</b>
  
- <b>Tell me about a time when you had to deal with conflict on the job.</b>
  - I would not say its a conflit rather than i was trying to convince my manager to prioritize my
  feature which is about to complete instead of working on some non functional requirement for upcomming sale 
  i was more baised about the feature as i was about to complete but as time demand we have to complete 
  some non-functional requirement which is mission critical
  - Me and my manager went on one to one meeting and try to figure-out the way to prioritize nfr test 
   and make sure that we conduct a session after this event so that each one of then team member have 
    context about this NFR process.
    
  


- <b>What assignment was too difficult for you, and how did you resolve the issue?</b>
  - For me it was little chalenging to work with non technical people and try to get along with them 
  - Template management is the very few project which i have worked on and make sure that all those 
  stackholder have the clear understanding about uses and time line
  - As oracle is big organisation and follow process very seriously and thorowaly
- <b>Give me an example of a difficult decision you had to make. How did you come to that decision?</b>
  - I was in navi and was part of personal loan i got an opportunity to work on a product 
  from scratch called home loan. I got assigned a team and was involved with product manager to 
  start working on requirement, The first solution is straight-forward and we just have to maintain
  the homeloan workflow as we were maintaining for personal loan 
  - But i wanted to try something else like some opensource solution for workflow management 
    i come across temporal which was an opensource exposed by uber. To make this decision i have to 
    convince stackholder as well as my team and the risk involved if it didn't workout well.
  - I will start documenting pros and cons about our use case and try to grab opportunity to discuss infront 
  of senior folks and architect.
  - By discussion with seniar folk i made my design document more robust and also able to convince some 
  some senior folks to atleast tryout this solution. as the scale of this project is not that good 
    so we are safe to make a bet on this approach 
    




- <b>Give an example of an idea you implemented.</b>
  - When i join the team then i can remeber the oncall was like a nightmare for any oncall engineer
  and we are getting lots of call so we have to reduce the alarm to figuredout what all alqam which trigger most 
  - When an alarm trigger it cut a jira ticket to our queue. so i search on internet and found a 
  plugin which generate report of alarm and their frequency on the daily basis.
  - The idea was to analyse the report and try to prioritize the alarm which is most frequitly trigged 
  and figureout some solution for them.
  - I have scheduled a regular meeting to analyse the report and make sure team is aware of those alarm and prioritize 
  action item for those alarm

- <b>Describe a mentor who has impacted you in a positive way.</b>
  - At initial days of my carrer i was very impetient person which is try to come up with a solution as
  soon as possible without thinking about the bigger picture. He identifies this problem and guide me to overcome this 
    issue and with his help i made a significant improvemnt in this 
    
- <b>Was there a person in your career who really made a difference? In what way?</b>
  Same as above 
  
- <b>Tell me about your proudest achievement.</b>
  - I was part of customer experience team of flipkart and when i join the team we have to create a 
  voice infrastructure platform which where a person can raise a complaint about the problem they are facing 
  - I was part of the team which initiate this project and it should be generic enough to support features which might come in 
  future like mutilingual support, multitenant tenant capability etc 
    
  - It have 2 major part like automated workflow and next part is routing and call center management 
  - We have to make sure that we have to make sure if that call is not able to solve a problem then it need to be routed to 
  a call center which is able to solve customer request based on availability and capability 
    
  - The majer problem we were facing is tht we have mutiple channel which was maintained by Cx Team 
    and they are working indipendently and maintaining their own workflow and state 
    
  - Suppose a person mailed his/her problem and reach till he/she explain about the problem to agent 
  but due to some issue she didn't wanted to continue with this channel and move towards some other channal 
    then he need to explain each and everything to that channel 
    
  - Each channel running differnt rule to make certain decision like give some discount and make some commitment 
  which is specific to that channel and does not hold throughout the flipkart 
    

  - So We comeup with a task where we have define certain sop for different different problem like refund return 
    and we have to define a single instance id for a perticuler issue insted of creating differnt 
    issue id according to their channel 
    
  - We have migrated all those data in single source and generate a 

  -
