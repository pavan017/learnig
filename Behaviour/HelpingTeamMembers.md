### what have you done to improve the productivity of others in the team 
- i was in OCI and when oncall is the nightmare for each enginneer
- when i onboarded on oncall routine then i realise that there is some issue which is occuring mutile time 
- We have to identify and prioritize them for example consumer lag 
- instead of doing it manually we got a jira plugin which will we can utilize to create a report about the issues which occured in a frquent manner 
- Instead of manually tracking them we generate a report and discuss the top occuring issue in our oncall meetup 
- As we are able to measure due to which we are able to prioritize top issues
- And eventually we have relax on call



- Was conducting and coordinating knowledge sharing program in our team.
- which gives opportunity to learn what others are doing in the team and discuss their thought process
- It provide a platform to share the knowledge and interact with senior folks and understand their thoughtprocess


- I have mostly looking for opportunity where document is not there 
- For example when i join microsoft there is no document for ingestion data to our system 
- It took some time to understand the process but it is not going to remember for lifetime 
- I took initiative to document it and share with all stack holder for the review 
- Once review is done i put it in internal wikipedia for the reference 
- Sometime latter new joinee and manager really appreciate that effort




### Tell me about a case where you mentor a person which help them to grow 
- I remember an intern join in our team and i got assigned her mentor 
- She was hardworking but shy/not openup as well.
- She put lots of efforts but hasitate to ask the help when got stuck
- I was observing that and as i was the mentor so really wanted that girl to succeed
- I made her comfertable and listen what made you stuck for lots of time 
- we end up having a plan that we can connect for 15 mins on daily basis where you can discuss the problem
- She found that meeting really helpful as this define the goal and improve the focus 
- I ask to met with other folks to get their thought process and ask for help imidiatelly when you stuck
