###Steps for Any System Design Problem 
- Understand the problem and establish the design scope 
    - Define functional Requirement 
    - Define non functional requirement 
    - Back of the envelope estimation
        - Define whether system is read heavy or write heavy
        - define estimated qps 
        - Define estimated data we are going to store 
        -
- Propose High Level Design 
    - High level design
        - define modules of the system for example demand and supply module etc
        
    - Data model 
    - Api/Interface design
    - Specific Algorithm to solve this problem
    - End to end flow
