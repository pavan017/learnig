## SSL (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yw-z6f7Mb4)

- How ssl certificate work 
   - When a client made a request to server and then server return the response
   - The problem in this is a middle man can sniff which we called man in the middle attack
   - We have to secure this communication from MMA
   - To secure this communication we can use encryption
   - To encrypt the data we required some key 
   - There is 2 kind of encryption 
     - Symatric Encryption
     - Asymetric Encryption

     - 
### Symatric Encryption
  - We have one key which we use for encryption and decryption
  - Suppose a client use that key to encrypt the data using key 
  - but as server does not have that key so it will not able to decrypt the data
  - if we sending key along with encrypted data then there is always a chance for MMA
  - One way we can physically share this key to server
   - In this case the problem is whenever we have to change the key we have to physically transfer that key 
   - This method is manual and required precision and resource

### Asymetric Encryption
  - here we are using 2 keys
    - public - encryption
    - private - decryption
  - Server will share public key to client may be hacker is also have this copy 
  - client uses public key to encrypt data and hacker which have public is not able to dycript this data as this information is onlyu dycrpt using private key
  - Server never sen this private key over network so hacker is not able to dycrpt this information
  - there is a posibility to hack this system if hacker act as a client 
  - suppose hacker intersept the request where you transfering public key fromserver to client 
    - it will share a public key generated by hacker and it pretend that this key is shared by server 
    - when client use this key to encrypt the data then hacker is able to dycrpt the data using the fake private key which is generated earlier


### SSL certificate 
- this certificate is authorised by some issuer 
  - suppose a issuer issue a certificate to the server which have following things 
    - it have two component
      - public key genrated by server 
      - signature (public key generated by server+ publickey generated by issuer for your domain)
  - when we share this certificate to client it it ask issuer to verify the signature
  - issuer check the whether this signature is correct or not using public key for given domain 
  - if signature is good then you can made the communication
